# 📚 Daily JavaScript Problems

Welcome to my **Daily JavaScript Practice** repo!  
I'm solving **one JavaScript problem every day** to sharpen my coding skills, explore new concepts, and stay consistent.

Each day's folder includes:
- ❓ A clear problem statement
- 💡 An explanation of how I solved it
- ✅ A working solution in JavaScript

## 🎯 Goal

Complete **100 days of JavaScript problem solving** to grow as a developer and build a strong portfolio.
